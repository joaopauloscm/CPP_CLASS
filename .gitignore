# =====================================
# This .gitignore was created with the help of AI
# Purpose:
#   - To make sharing my C++ learning cleaner and easier
#   - Hide executables, build files, system files, and editor configs
#   - Keep only source code (.cpp, .h) visible on GitHub
# =====================================

# Ignore macOS system files
.DS_Store

# Ignore build artifacts
*.out
*.exe
*.o

# Ignore debug symbols and profiler output

*.stackdump

# =====================================
# What to keep
